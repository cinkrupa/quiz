## 🗄️ Database Schema

The existing `players` table supports the leaderboard:
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_answers INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for efficient leaderboard queries
CREATE INDEX players_score_idx ON players(score DESC);
CREATE INDEX players_updated_at_idx ON players(updated_at DESC);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Data
Created `sample-data.sql` with test players for development:
- 12 sample players with various scores
- Realistic names and score distributions
- Can be used to test leaderboard display

### API Testing
```bash
# Test leaderboard API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/players?action=leaderboard
```
